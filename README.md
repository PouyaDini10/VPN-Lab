## üìç Understanding IP addresses & VPN's

What is an IP(Internet Protocol) address? 

You can think of **IP(Internet Protocol)** addresses as your home address, every device is assigned a unique identifier that's used to send and receive data. IP addresses come in two forms:

**Public IPs** - visible on the internet

**Private IPs** - used within your own internal network

<br>

**IPv4 -** Internet Protocol version 4 

Most common version of IP addresses used today
192.168.1.1(an example)

**IPv6 -** Internet Protocol version 6

A newer version, created because were in shortage of IPv4 addresses
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334(an example)

**Static IP addresses -** fixed

**Dynamic IP addresses -** the IP address changes over time(usually through ISP or DHCP)

<br>

**VPN(Virtual Private Network)**

What is a VPN? 

A VPN creates a secured, encrypted network tunnel between your device and the internet. Essentially, it hides your IP by routing traffic through a VPN server in another country.
